This mock-up marketing site demonstrates CSS animations within the responsive navigation bar and the SlidesJS image  
banner carousel. CSS animations are useful in creating dynamic web pages that look modern and act responsively. CSS is  
continuing to expand its capabilities, but it's important to consider what is compatible with the range of different  
browsers that are used. CSS animations are fun and can make a web page look and feel much more lively, but it may not  
always work for the user.

The responsive navigation nar and image banner carousel require JavaScript files accessed via CDNs or in the lib
directory. The responsive nav also required a fixed responsive nav plugin and other plugins that tailored it to its  
fixed properties. All linked files are located above the </body> tag.
